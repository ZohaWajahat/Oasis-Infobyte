# Introduction

In order to achieve a successful completion of the Python Programming internship, I will be tasked with the responsibility of completing five essential tasks. These tasks have been carefully designed to provide me with a comprehensive learning experience during my internship tenure. The successful fulfillment of these five tasks is pivotal in determining the overall success of my internship journey. Each of these assignments is crafted to enhance my skills and contribute to mu growth as a python programmer. As you embark on this internship, these five tasks will be my primary milestones towards a rewarding experience. <br />

# Tasks
# Task 2
# BMI Calculator
Create a command-line BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and category to the user.  <br />

# Task 3
# Random Password Generator
 Develop an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. Enhance it by including options for password complexity, adherence to security rules, and clipboard integration for easy copying. <br />

# Task 4
# Basic Weather App

Develop a graphical weather app with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Enable users to input their location or use GPS for automatic detection. Provide detailed weather data, including current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, wind speed, and visual elements like weather icons. <br />
